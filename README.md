## 📌 Introduction
**Already Down!** is a powerful tool designed to continuously monitor the availability of a target server using multiple testing methods. This tool checks whether a server is down by performing:

- **HTTP Status Checks** (Checks HTTP response codes)
- **ICMP Ping Tests** (Checks network availability via ICMP)
- **TCP Connection Tests** (Checks port connectivity)

If all three methods fail, the tool congratulates you for successfully bringing the server down! 🎉

## ⚠️ Important Warning
🚨 **Notice:** If this tool is used in a network where a Dos/DDoS test is being performed, the external IP may get blocked by the target server or firewall. This can result in the tool always showing the target as "down," even if it is still online. Be sure to verify the results through multiple sources before making any conclusions!

## 🚀 Features
